# Nim Game Built Using Yew.rs

A web application of nim-game using Rust & Yew.rs technologies implementing a minimax algorithm for counter moves.

## Game Logic

- Upon starting the game, you'll be presented with a row of Ferris crabs whose count varies between 15-21.
- The game is played between user, who represents the player, and computer acting as the opponent.
- User starts off by removing one or two crabs from the row as a beginning.
- Afterward, computer counters the player's move using the minimax algorithm.
- The game keeps continuing until a player removes the last crab (or crabs), and the one who accomplishes this is declared the winner.

## Contribution

I'd love to meet your contributions on this project. As someone who improves his Rust skills, working together with Rustaceans would be a cuddly gesture.
